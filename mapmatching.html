									<h1>Abstract</h1>	
									We develop a Map Matching service and an Attribute Prediction
service for the collaborative multi-project, aSTEP.
These two solutions are a part of the spatial and spatiotemporal
components. To perform map matching, we investigate
different techniques. We choose GraphHopperâ€™s
Routing Engine, which employs a Hidden Markov Model.
To adjust the performance of map matching, we have experimented
with the Error-sigma and transition probability-b.
We end up with 43 as the Error-sigma and 2 as the transition
probability-beta. Due to the lack ground truth data for the
map matching task, our experiments are evaluated based
on our expectation of a given trajectory.
For the Attribute Prediction service, we develop two
micro-services. The Graph Attribute micro-service, which
is responsible for interacting with end-users and fetching
graphs from the database. The Attribute Prediction
micro-service has the responsibility of predicting speed
limit of any road network. We investigate different graph
embedding and prediction algorithms and conclude that
node2vec and relational fusion networks will be the main
techniques. We utilise node2vec to embed the input graph
and on the dual graph to get node and edge attributes. We
also use the angle between the edges as our between-edge
attributes. With these attributes, we train the network and
model with a training loss at 115.68, validation loss at
155.38, and a test loss at 164.35. This model is inadequate
for optimally predicting speed limits on road networks.
In conclusion, we have developed working micro-services
for map matching and missing attributes prediction on
road networks. We have implemented the functionality
for further training of models.

									<h3 class="major">My Contributions</h3>
									<p>The project was a collaboration between 5 people, therefore, I have decided to outline some features I worked on. My focus was placed on performing the map matching part of the project, including implementing a Hidden Markov Model on the aSTEP toolchain. Creating a UI for the implementation and testing its intergration with other system. I also worked on implementing a Relational Fusion Network, which is an experimental neural network architecture to encapture road network relations. As part of this project I also worked with node2vec, graph2vec and worked as the group represententive for collaboration on aSTEP.
