									<h1>Abstract</h1>	
									The report explores how machine intelligence can be used
in order to detect breast cancer in mammograms. The
mortality rate of breast cancer is increased if the cancer is
not detected early, and false-negative diagnoses are, therefore, fatal at worst. Different diagnosis techniques were
investigated, and classification was chosen as the most
suitable, since the different diagnoses can be treated as
classes. Furthermore, neural networks and convolutional
neural networks were chosen as the preferred method of
machine learning since it works well with the images in
the CBIS-DDSM dataset. A ’One Vs. All’ (Divide & Conquer) strategy and a strategy for classifying all five diagnoses simultaneously were tested. The Divide & Conquer
strategy yielded better results but might contradict itself,
i.e. two different models diagnose the same image positive. The classifier working on all different diagnoses at
once shows some levels of uncertainty, but won’t produce
contradicting results. In conclusion, both strategies give
an educated answer based on the input.

									<h3 class="major">My Contributions</h3>
									<p>The project was a collaboration between 5 people, therefore, I have decided to outline some features I worked on. Data preprocessing and data augmentation was performed on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, which allowed for increased accuracy of the models, in 'One vs All' and Single model type. Besides that I worked heavily on the training and tuning of the models and did the visualization of results.
